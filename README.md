### About

This thesis deals with the design and prototyping of a smart system that, using data from user behavior records in a smart home and a learning model, detects regular routines and sets or controls some smart devices according to them. The goal of this work is to automate smart devices in the home, depending on the user's routines, and make them easier to use.
  Smartwatches were used as a data source for sleep data, logging changes in the settings of smart devices depending on their previous settings in specific situations, and multiple sensors generating records of user behavior.
  A Linear Regression model was chosen to run on a Raspberry Pi, which is also used to manually manage the smart devices and the rest of the system.
  In addition to controlling individual devices, the system created also supports sending alerts when the recommended sleep start time is approaching, or when anomalies in user behaviour are detected.
